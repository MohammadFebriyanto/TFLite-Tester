# TFLite-Tester

This is example project showing a couple different ways of testing TensorFLow Lite models. It contains code for:

- Converting TensorFlow to TensorFlow Lite model,
- Comparing TF and TF Lite models side by side (including post-training quantization)
- Running automated tests on Android application with Espresso library.
